## Why

Learning names is hard. Especially hard when you have a large group of names to learn quickly.

If you have had a chance to get associated with the names in a fun way before hand you will pick them up much faster and won't face existential worries of not remembering peoples names and feeling like a lemon üçã

---

## What

Load data from a team on Github and then preview the names and faces.

Play a space invaders style game where you shoot the correct face that matches the name being displayed and win points.

---

## Instructions

1. Add the organisation and team you are looking for in github
2. Preview the names and faces to get familiar
3. Play game - Use left and right keys to navigate the player and space bar to shoot

---

## Collaborate??

Interested in learning names and think it can be done better? Get involved!

Stretch ideas:

1. Integrate with LinkedIn
2. Add a DB such as using airtable to create hard coded groups with accurate names and faces
3. Allow the user to just upload the names and faces they want to learn
4. Different types of games.

- FlipCard game
- Snake

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
